            <h4 class="my-0 text-danger">Naturophatic principle</h4>
            <p class="mb-3">Naturopathic medicine is based on the belief that the human body has an innate healing ability. Individuals are taught to use diet, exercise, lifestyle changes and natural therapies to improve their bodies’ abilities to prevent and treat disease. The person is also educated to emphasize self–responsibility for health.</p>
            <p class="mb-3">In employing this principle, ProNaturals underscore disease prevention, assessment of risk factors and hereditary susceptibility to disease and make appropriate interventions to prevent illness. It strives to create a healthy community in which Filipinos in good physical shape may thrive.</p>
